Upgrade RedKite CMS to use composer
===================================
RedKite CMS repository has been redesigned to simplify the development. That change
involved the whole cms bundles which have been moved from the application vendor folder
to the src one.

Due to that change RedKite CMS bundles have been removed from composer because they come
with the application itself.
