How to navigate through the website pages
=========================================

This chapter explains in detail how to navigate through the website pages.

Navigation
----------

Moving through the website pages when you are in the CMS backend is a really simple
operation: just click on a link that points an internal page and RedKite CMS will 
move to that page. 

The page you are browsing must not be in in editing mode to navigate through the website
pages.

Sometimes the page link you want to reach may not be available on the page you are  
on at the moment or it may happen that that page has not been linked yet.  Or you are in edit 
modeand you do not want to turn off the contents editor just to click a link on a page.

When this situation occurs, the **Nav** menu helps you. This small blue partially 
hidden panel is located under the **Edit** button and contains two combo boxes 
which lists the whole website languages and pages.

Just click on the **Nav** button and the panel opens. Now choose the page or language
from the appropriate combobox and RedKite CMS will immediately move to it.

Edit an internal link
---------------------

Pages can be linked together in several ways: you can use the link Block, which is the 
one delegated to manage links or you can add a link to a hypertext block using the 
inline editor.

Sometimes you would like to change the permalink of a page: if this page has already been
linked through the website, RedKite CMS updates all the links that points to that page for you.


Navigate through languages
--------------------------

As explained above, you can move through the website languages using the **Nav** menu.  But,
in a multi-languages website, you should use the Languages Navigation Menu Block, which 
renders a menu made by languages flags. 

Each flag is automatically linked to the page you are browsing, pointing the appropriate
language.

For example, if you are building a website in English and Italian and you have a contacts page,
when you click the flag that represent the English language, RedKite CMS will move to the
contact page in English and when you click on the Italian flag you will be redirected to the
same page for the Italian language.
