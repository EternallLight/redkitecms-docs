How to navigate through the website pages
=========================================

This chapter explains in detail how to navigate through the website pages.

Navigation
----------

Moving through the website pages when you are in the CMS backend, is a really simple
operation: you can just click on a link that points an internal page and AlphaLemon 
CMS will move to that page. 

To navigate in this way, the page you are browsing must not be in in contents
editing mode.

Sometimes the page link you want to reach is not available on the page you are browsing 
at the moment or it may happen that that page has not been linked yet or you are in edit mode 
and you do not want to turn off the contents editor, just to click a link on a page.

When this situation occours, the **Nav** menu helps you. This small blue partially 
hidden panel is placed under the **Edit** button and contains two combo boxes 
where are listed the whole website languages and pages.

Just click on the **Nav** button and the panel opens. Now choose the page or language
to move to from the appropriate combobox and AlphaLemon CMS will immediatly move to.

Edit an internal link
---------------------

Pages can be linked together in several ways: you can use the link Block, the one deputated to 
manage links or you can add a link into an hypertext block, using the inline editor.

Sometimes you would like to change the permalink of a page: if this page has already been
linked through the website, AlphaLemon CMS updates the links to that page for you, in all
the contents that the old link is present.


Navigate through languages
--------------------------

As explained above you can move through website languages using the **Nav** menu but,
in a multi-languages website, you must use the Languages Navigation Menu Block, which 
renders a menu made with the website languages flags. 

Each flag is automatically linked the the page you are browsing, pointing the appropriate
language.

For example if you are building a website in English and Italian and you have a contacts page,
when you click the flag that represent the English language, AlphaLemon CMS will move to the
contact page in English and when you click on the Italian flag you will be redirected to the
same page for the italian language.
