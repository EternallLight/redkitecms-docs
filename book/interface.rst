RedKite CMS editor interface
============================

This chapter contains an overview of the RedKite CMS editor interface.

The interface
-------------

After you sign in, RedKite CMS redirects you to the main page of yoursite
and loads the editor to manage the whole website.

RedKite CMS is an inline application, this means you can edit the website contents
directly on each page of your website.

The contro panel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When you start the editor the first time, the control panel is a small box placed 
in the top left corner of the page.

This box contains can be moved on the vertical axis by clicking the small arrows placed
on the box top and bottom.

The box can be moved in three positions, the first one is in the top left corner of
the page, in the middle of the page

and in the bottom.

The control panel can be expanded so all the available commands are displayed

and then it can be maximized

The control panel position and status are saved, so when you will move to pages or reopen
the editor, the control panel is restored in the same position where it had been 
left.

The minimized control panel has just three available commands:

1. The button to toggle the control panel from mini to maximized (black arrow)
2. The command to edit the contents on the page (green arrow)
3. The command to open the quick navigation menu

Edit contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit contents, just click on the **Edit** button: this operation makes
the editable blocks active and ready for changes. Click the edit button again to toggle to
**Stop**

A **Block** is a container for different kinds of content.  So we may have
a block that contains hypertext content, a block that contains an image, a block 
that contains a link and so on. 

Each Block has an appropriate inline editor to handle the content.

This topic is covered in detail in the `blocks management`_ chapter.


Navigate through website pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RedKite CMS let you navigate through website pages by:

1. Clicking directly on internal page links
2. Using the **Nav** menu located under the **Edit** button

This topic is covered in detail in the `navigate through the website`_ chapter.
