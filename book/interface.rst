RedKite CMS editor interface
============================

This chapter contains an overview of the RedKite CMS editor interface.

The interface
-------------

After you sign in, RedKite CMS redirects you to the main page of your website
and loads the editor to manage the whole website.

RedKite CMS is an inline application, this means you can edit the website contents
directly on each page of your website.

When the CMS is started, the home page is loaded and you can immediately start editing it.

The interface has been minimized to have the less impact on page:

Edit contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To edit contents, just click on the **Edit** button: this operation makes
the editable blocks active and ready for changes. Click the edit button again to toggle to
**Stop**

A **Block** is a container for different kinds of content.  So we may have
a block that contains hypertext content, a block that contains an image, a block 
that contains a link and so on. 

Each Block has an appropriate inline editor to handle the content.

This topic is covered in detail in the `blocks management`_ chapter.


Navigate through website pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

RedKite CMS let you navigate through website pages by:

1. Clicking directly on internal page links
2. Using the **Nav** menu located under the **Edit** button

This topic is covered in detail in the `navigate through the website`_ chapter.
    
The toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~

The toolbar is placed at the top of the page and is hidden by default. In the middle
top of the screen there is a small tab with a white down arrow that opens the toolbar
when you click it.

The toolbar contains all the commands you need to manage the website, like pages, languages,
themes and more.  Most of these commands open a panel that drops down from the toolbar and
display a panel with an interface that lets you manage the section.

From the toolbar you can also change the RedKite CMS interface language.
