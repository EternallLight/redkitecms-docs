Getting started
===============

RedKite CMS is a Content Management System application built on top of the Symfony2
and Twitter Bootstrap frameworks.

What does this mean? Let's look further:

A **Content Management System (CMS)** is a system that let you manage, edit, store and publish
website contents in a repository.  You can directly edit the contents of the pages in your browser where it is easier to 
visualize what the final product will look like.

Most CMS's do not require you to have programming skills to use.

**Symfony2** is a PHP framework. A framework is a set of libraries designed with the 
purpose to simplify common developing tasks. This one provides a robust security layer, implements 
tools to prevent your website from common web attacks, provides a routing system to 
manage the website navigation, provides the tools to interact with a database and more.

Symfony2 was chosen because it is really powerful and easy to use and has a strong and active community.

If you decide to use RedKite CMS to build your website, you must understand that you
are choosing to build a Symfony2 website and you must trust me that this framework is really
awesome.  But you are encouraged to `learn more about it`_ before you do.

**Twitter Bootstrap** is a collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. 
It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, charts, 
navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

This framework helps you build a professional looking website without the need to design 
everything from scratch.

The RedKite CMS default theme is a professional looking theme built on top of this framework,
which has been adapted for our application. 

Take a look at the Twitter Bootstrap `official gallery`_ where several websites built with Twitter Bootstrap are showcased.

If all of this sounds appealing to you, you can immediately learn `how to install`_ your first RedKite 
CMS application.  After that, jump to the `quick start`_ documents if you are impatient.  Or you can simply continue reading `the book`_.
